      "description": "Inception is a science fiction action thriller film about a skilled thief, Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), who steals information from people's dreams by infiltrating their subconscious.

This involves entering multiple layers of dreams within dreams, creating a complex and surreal world where reality blurs with the subconscious. ",
